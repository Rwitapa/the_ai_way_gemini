## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up your own Firebase project and Razorpay account.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v22.x recommended)
* A Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled.
* A Razorpay account for API keys.

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/the-ai-way-gemini.git](https://github.com/your-username/the-ai-way-gemini.git)
    cd the-ai-way-gemini
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your Firebase and Razorpay credentials.

    ```env
    # Firebase Client Keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:..:web:...

    # Firebase Admin Keys (for server-side operations)
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-...@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
    FIRE"Hello! I am Gemini, a large language model trained by Google. I can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way."BASE_APP_ID=1:..:web:... # Yes, this can be the same as the public one

    # Razorpay Keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_...
    RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_...
    RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...
    RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...

    # Cron Job Secret
    CRON_SECRET=a-very-strong-secret-key
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Architectural Decisions

* **Serverless-First**: All backend logic is handled through Next.js API Routes, which are deployed as serverless functions on Vercel. This approach is cost-effective and scales automatically.
* **Client-Side State**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used for managing UI state, such as toggling modals and handling form inputs.
* **Dynamic Imports**: Non-critical components like modals are loaded dynamically to reduce the initial JavaScript bundle size and improve page load performance.
* **Image Optimization**: The `next/image` component is used to automatically optimize and lazy-load images, improving the Core Web Vitals score.
* **Security Headers**: `next.config.js` is configured to add HTTP security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
